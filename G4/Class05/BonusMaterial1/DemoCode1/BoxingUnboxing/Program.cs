			// All value types derive from object
			// That is why we can box any value type in to object
			int number1 = 9000;
			object obj1 = number1;
			Console.WriteLine(obj1); // works

			// Unboxing an object back in to integer
			// Since an object variable can hold any value we can try and unbox it to a specific type
			object obj2 = 9000;
			int number2 = (int)obj2; // -> This change of type is called casting
			Console.WriteLine(number2); // works
			Console.ReadLine();

			// Note: Casting changes the type, but does not change the object value
			// It is different than converting since converting tries to change the value to match another type
			// Casting just changes the type if the value is eligable to exist in that type as well
			// A good example is unboxing since object and int can both hold the number 9000
			// There is no need to change the number since it can exist in both of the types
