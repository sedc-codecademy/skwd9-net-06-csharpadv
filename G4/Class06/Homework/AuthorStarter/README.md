# Model

The model is in the `AuthorModel.cs` file. It consists of an author and book classes, with enumerations for genre and book type.

# Data

The data is in the `AuthorRepo.cs` file. **DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE IN VISUAL STUDIO**, as it has about half a million lines, and it will freeze VS for a while. All the code you need to write can be done inside `Program.cs`, maybe with helper classes and files.

There's no need to edit anything in the `AuthorRepo.cs`.
